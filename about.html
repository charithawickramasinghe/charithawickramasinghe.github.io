            <p> Nice to meet you, friend! My name is Andrew Shade. I’m a professional photographer from Denver, state Colorado. I hope, that you will enjoy with my photo portfolio and after that we can create something great together!</p>

            <p>Through the lens the world looks different and i would like to show you this difference. I learned that from age 10, when I was first time take photos on manual camera with my Dad. After that with years of practice and tons of experience I learned the techniques, that helps me in my work with modern brands and companies. And all of this may be yours, just get in touch.</p>
